                            We began with a joint brainstorming session around gamification, aiming to find a subject that felt important and relevant to everyone on the team. Our focus landed on physical health and well-being, and we investigated how game mechanics could be used to promote a sustainable lifestyle.
                            To understand the market, we conducted research on existing fitness and health apps, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. We also performed a Lightning Demo to identify features and patterns we wanted to be inspired by, as well as areas where we could innovate.

                            The next step was to clarify what type of motivation we wanted to work with. We brainstormed around intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and discussed which driving forces we wanted the app to support.

Based on this, we formulated our central “How Might We” question:
“How might we make a healthy lifestyle more fun and easier?”

This question became the foundation for the work that followed.

                            We created personas to understand our target audience’s needs, motivations, and challenges. Using these, we developed proposals for mechanisms and reward systems that would feel motivating and sustainable.

To quickly test our ideas, we worked with lo-fi prototypes that we user-tested. Afterwards, we conducted a Crazy 8 exercise, where we rapidly generated multiple new solution ideas and iterations of our concept.

                         We continued to develop prototypes and iterate based on feedback, with the goal of finding a balance between simplicity, motivation, and enjoyment. The process helped us arrive at a solution that not only promotes physical activity but also fosters harmony and well-being on the user’s own terms.

                         A central part of the process was keeping the user in focus. We created personas and scenarios to understand different types of needs, from those who want to take small steps toward a healthier everyday life, to those who are already active but seeking balance. This was complemented by storyboards where we mapped the user’s journey through the app, to more clearly see how motivation and reward systems would be experienced over time.

When designing Kenneth, we chose to work with a green color palette in various calm shades. The choice of color was deliberate and based on the psychology of colors.

Green is often associated with balance, harmony, and nature—three values that align with our vision for the app. Unlike many other fitness apps that use bold, intense colors (like red or orange) to signal energy and performance, we wanted to create a sense of security and calm.

By using green tones, we enhance the experience that exercise and health don’t have to feel pressuring, but can feel natural, sustainable, and welcoming. The color serves as a subtle reminder that the user sets their own pace, and that the journey toward well-being is just as important as the outcome.
